   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bridge-backend.git
   cd bridge-backend
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory and add the environemnt variables we have sent through email

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   MONGO_URI= "example uri here"
   JWT_SECRET=suA0vqsGSF
   ```

4. **Start the backend server**:

   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```

   The backend server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

   Follow the instructions provided by the React Native CLI to run the application on your desired platform (iOS, Android, or web).

## Future Milestones

- **User Profile Management**: Implement user profile editing and viewing, profile picture upload functionality.
- **Post Interactions**: Enable users to like and comment on posts, implement notifications for post interactions.
- **Spotify Authentication Integration**: Integrate Spotify authentication using OAuth, allow users to link their Spotify account and display listening history on their profile.
